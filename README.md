# myProject
Project started at CodersLab Romania

A web application that will handle all the underground electronic music events. All the events in one place, where promoters can share their events and promote them and users can review/rate them or buy tickets directly through the app. For this project I am using:

`HTML`
`SASS`
`RWD`
`React.js`

`npm`
`Gulp`
`Webpack`
`Babel`
